The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 35.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 80.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 19.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 10.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (11,15.6,46)
